This is another method to setup an xsession which allows you to execute
commads before the CDE Xsession gets executed. 
This alternate method is useful when for example you need to 
set a different language.

In this example we 
1. have the login manager execute /usr/dt/bin/startxsession.sh script
2. The /usr/dt/bin/startxsession.sh first sets properly the LANG variable
	(or you can add whatever you want to execute before CDE Xsession starts)
	and then executes /usr/dt/bin/Xsession which will start CDE.

To install, after you edit the startxsession.sh to your liking, do as root:

cp /path/to/cdesktopenv-code/cde/contrib/desktopentry/cde-alt.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/
cp /path/to/cdesktopenv-code/cde/contrib/desktopentry/startxsession.sh /usr/dt/bin/
chmod ugo+rx /usr/dt/bin/startxsession.sh
